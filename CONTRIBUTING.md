This Repository was entirely created by `ARGHA SARDAR` (or `arghacious@gmail.com`) as a hobby project, which turned out to be quite useful for sharing Student details of the `M.Tech. Cryptology and Security` students of `Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata`. 

As of Now, PR's are only accepted from the stakeholders of `CRYPTOPATHS`. For any further requests please contact `arghacious@gmail.com`.
